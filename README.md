"Detecting Lung Cancer with 96% Accuracy Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model in Google Colab"

This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to detect lung cancer with a high accuracy rate of 96% in Python. Implemented in Google Colab, the project aims to classify and predict lung cancer presence based on various medical data inputs. The ANN model is trained and tested on a labeled dataset containing relevant health and diagnostic information. Through data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, the model achieves a high level of accuracy, demonstrating its potential as a support tool for early detection of lung cancer, which is critical for effective treatment and patient outcomes.
